**Project Idea:**
<br />
Simulate a game where the user tries to dodge incoming objects (blocks) using their mouse. The user can only move left and right and starts and ends at the bottom of the screen. The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible. As soon as an incoming object collides with the player, the game ends. Details such as length of time survived and power-ups active will show on screen. Power-ups may include invinsibility, slow-down-time, and decreasing player size. This idea was inpsired by the game "Subway Surfers" and the recent "Ideal Particles" MP. As time goes on, the speed of incoming objects will increase, making it harder for the player to dodge.

**Project Timeline**
Week 1--> Write test cases. Have all function signatures written.
<br />
Week 2--> Have the basic framework of the game working.
<br />
Week 3--> Implement power-ups and difficulty level over time. Player should be able to move and dodge objects.
<br />
Week 4--> Make the game asethetically pleasing. Add power-up counters, game details, etc. Add extra features to the game.
<br />
<br />
**Extra "stretch goals"**
<br />
Add different "avatars" for the player.
<br />
Add different images instead of having incoming objects as blocks.
<br />
Add asesthetic effects to the player once a power-up is obtained.

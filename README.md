**Obstacle Simulator**

This project simulates an endless game where the player's goal is to dodge incoming obstacles. With each level passed, the difficulty increases, but the player has a chance to grab a power-up on each level. The game can be paused/unpaused using the space-bar and restarted by clicking on the "Delete" key. The player moves by clicking on the left and right arrow-key. The project was built from scratch and uses many of Cinder's features.

To run the game, simply click run on the "run-game" configuration.
